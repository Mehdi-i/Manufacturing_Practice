# Manufacturing Practice

## Facial Recognition Attendance System

This project is a real-time facial recognition attendance system developed using Python and OpenCV. It aims to automate attendance marking by identifying students through facial recognition.

### Requirements

This project is requiring the installation of OpenCV and Pillow libraries. You can run the following script in terminal to install it.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Key Features

- **Real-time face recognition:** The system uses OpenCV's facial recognition algorithms to identify students in real-time.
- **Accurate and reliable:** The system has been trained on a large dataset of student faces and has achieved high accuracy.
- **User-friendly interface:** The system has a simple user interface that is easy to use for both teachers and students.
- **Scalable:** The system can be easily scaled to accommodate a large number of students.

### How it Works

[^1] **Data Collection:** The system collects a set of images of each student's face.
[^2] **Model Training:** The system uses the collected images to train a facial recognition model.
[^3] **Attendance Marking:** The system uses the trained model to identify students in real-time.
[^4] **Reporting:** The system generates a report of attendance for each class.

### Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- JSON

### Installation

To install the system, clone the repository from GitHub and install the required dependencies.

### Usage

[^1] Run the `face_taker.py` script to collect images of each student's face.
[^2] Run the `face_train.py` script to train the facial recognition model.
[^3] Run the `face_recognizer.py` script to start the attendance system.
